`.bf` is the file extension commonly associated with Brainfuck, which is a minimalist programming language known for its extremely small set of commands. Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. The language provides a limited set of commands that manipulate the memory cells and produce outputs.

Here are the Brainfuck commands:

1. `>`: Increment the memory pointer (move to the right).
2. `<`: Decrement the memory pointer (move to the left).
3. `+`: Increment the byte at the memory pointer.
4. `-`: Decrement the byte at the memory pointer.
5. `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the memory pointer is zero.
6. `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the memory pointer is nonzero.
7. `.`: Output the byte at the memory pointer as an ASCII character.
8. `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the memory pointer.

A Brainfuck program is composed of these commands, and it can be quite challenging to read and understand due to its minimalistic nature and lack of human-friendly syntax.

For example, the following Brainfuck code snippet increments the first memory cell value by 1 and outputs the corresponding ASCII character:

```brainfuck
++++ .
```

Brainfuck is often used for educational purposes and for creating small, efficient programs that demonstrate the concept of a Turing-complete language. However, its minimalism and cryptic syntax make it quite difficult to write practical programs in Brainfuck.
